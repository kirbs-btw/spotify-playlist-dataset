Possible different approches to do the search
main goal right now is to get data to songs in 3 Languages English, Spanish and German for the purpouse of this mvp

Naive approche for search:
    a
    b
    c
    ...
    aa
    ab
    ... 

Approche to get new songs data: 
Could go on base on the filter new? Find out what the new songs are... because in the end the user wants to find new stuff.. 
Then take the data from new songs and finde playlists from those songs forward

use the market parameter to maybe only get songs in the different languages? need to look deeper But thats i connected to the own user country settings... hard to alter. Maybe setting up 3 accounts for the regions. 
Generally this param could also mean to support index music and so on to be in line with local legslation
