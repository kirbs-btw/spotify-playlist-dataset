# Spotify Playlist API
## Analysis
Retrieving 5 million playlists with new data is quite challenging due to limitations in the API. For each search, there is a maximum of 1,000 playlists available, and each request can only retrieve up to 50 playlists. This means that around 100,000 requests would be needed, especially with 5,000 search request phrases.

Additionally, the API typically supports only up to 10,000 playlists per hour, which translates to roughly 500 hours of API usage if that limit holds true. To overcome this limitation, one potential approach could be to create multiple accounts, deploy scripts on different seed/offsets, and potentially rotate IP addresses to avoid getting blocked. The offset parameter could mean different things, such as being applied to a single playlist or across multiple playlists.

## Capabilities
- Ability to retrieve playlists via search queries.
- Support for a market parameter, which may help filter songs by specific regions or languages, though it's primarily connected to the user's country settings and might be difficult to alter. This could potentially require setting up multiple accounts for different regions (English, Spanish, German).
- Possibility to fetch new songs data using specific filters to focus on fresh music.

## Limits
- Maximum of 1,000 playlists per search.
- Maximum of 50 playlists per request.
- API supports only up to 10,000 playlists per hour.
- Extensive time required for large-scale data collection (up to 500 hours).
- Potential for IP blocking due to high request volume.
- Difficulty in adjusting the market parameter across different regions due to reliance on user country settings.
